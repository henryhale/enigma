_The World War II's cryptic game-changer, a mechanical marvel of secrecy and encryption_

</div>

## Overview

This repository features a TypeScript simulation of the iconic Enigma machine â€” _an encryption device used by the German military during World War II._

Having watched [The Imitation Game](http://theimitationgamemovie.com/) movie with prior understanding of cryptography, I decided to challenge myself into creating a simulation of the basic functionality of the original Enigma machines. Then later try to break it just like Alan Turing and his collegues did.

Now the first step is done ðŸŽ‰

The rest of this document tells what I found out and provides a guide to run the simulation on your computer.

## How it Works

The Enigma machine consisted of rotors, reflector, plugboard and a keyboard.
Each key press initiated a complex encryption process involving the rotation of rotors and the reflection of signals.
Its daily-changing settings posed a significant challenge to Allied codebreakers.

The process of transforming an input character involves a sequence of steps through various components, including the plugboard, rotors, reflector, and plugboard again before reaching the lampboard.
Here's a brief description of the transformation pipeline:

1. **Plugboard:**

   - The input character enters the plugboard, where initial letter swaps occur. Pairs of letters are connected, providing an additional layer of complexity to the encryption.

2. **Rotors:**

   - The character then passes through a series of rotors, each with its own internal wiring. As the rotors rotate with each keypress, the electrical signal is further scrambled through these intricate pathways.

3. **Reflector:**

   - After passing through the rotors, the signal is directed to the reflector. The reflector ensures that the signal is then sent back through the rotors in a different path, contributing to the complexity of the encryption.

4. **Rotors (again):**

   - The signal, now reflected, passes through the rotors again in the reverse direction. This double-pass through the rotors adds a crucial non-linearity to the encryption process.

5. **Plugboard (again):**

   - The signal re-enters the plugboard for a second letter swap. This final permutation provides an additional layer of complexity to the output.

6. **Lampboard:**
   - The transformed signal finally reaches the lampboard, where the illuminated letter represents the encrypted output. This letter corresponds to the final encrypted character.

The transformation process involves a carefully orchestrated series of steps through various components, creating a highly secure and dynamic encryption process during each keypress.
